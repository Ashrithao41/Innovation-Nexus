# Develop-2D-grid-by-using-4-overhead-cameras
The project aims to create a system that captures images from multiple cameras in a 3D room, stitches these images into a seamless panoramic view, and converts the stitched image into a 2D grid map. This grid map will represent object positions and dimensions, enabling efficient robot navigation and obstacle avoidance.
